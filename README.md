# Discord Data Downloader

Discord bot example built to export full list of members in a guild.

This application will generate a CSV file with the name specified in config.json

## Discord Bot Setup

In order to run this script you need to create a Discord Bot in the following web address:
https://discord.com/developers/applications

- Click "New Application", choose a name for your bot, e.g. "User Helper" and click "Create".

- Click "Bot", click "Add Bot" button, click "Yes, do it!".

- Click "Reset Token" to retrieve the API Bot Token, click "Yes, do it!". Write down the TOKEN and don't lose it.

- (Optional) Change bot ICON to make it look less dull ðŸ˜‰

- Enable "SERVER MEMBERS INTENT" in the same page.

- Click "OAuth2", click "URL Generator", enable "bot" and "Administrator". Copy the "GENERATED URL" address below, and paste it in a new browser tab.

- Choose your server from the list and click "Continue" to allow the bot join your server.

There your are. You have your bot ready and installed in your server. Now let's continue with the script installation.
## Script Installation

- Download github project in your hard drive and download all NPM modules

- You will need Node.js installed in your machine (e.g. https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and ideally a good IDE tool (e.g. https://code.visualstudio.com/)

```bash
  npm install
```

- Generate a config.json file in root directory with these parameters. You should already have the TOKEN from the previous step. The Guild ID is the ID of your server. You can obtain this value by enabling the "Developer Mode" in Discord preferences, and the right-click your server icon and then click "Copy ID". Filename is needed to choose your preferred file name for the output.

```bash
  {
    "token": "<Discord Bot Token>",
    "guildID": "<Target Guild ID>",
    "filename": "<Output CSV filename, e.g. output.csv>"
  }
```

- Run application

```bash
  node index.js
```
